    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a hearty Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy ricotta or béchamel, and melted mozzarella cheese. The layers are baked until bubbly and golden, creating a perfect combination of textures. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The pasta softens as it absorbs the sauce, while the cheeses provide a creamy, indulgent finish. With every bite, you get a balanced mix of savory flavors and satisfying comfort. This dish is perfect for family dinners or gatherings, as it's both filling and crowd-pleasing.
